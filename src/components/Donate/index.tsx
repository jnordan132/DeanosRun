        The Full Moon Healing Studio has partnered with Dr. Tara Ferguson,
        Owner, and Licensed Psychologist of Place of Peace Counseling and
        Therapeutic Center in Wilmington, NC. Together we have created a
        donation based scholarship program that provides free mental health
        counseling to those in our community who are unable to afford it. 100%
        of your donation goes towards this program.
