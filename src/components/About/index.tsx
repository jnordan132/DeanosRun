      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        March 28, 2021 I lost my big brother, Dean, who was struggling severely
        with his mental health. My brother was my best friend and the most
        genuine person I have ever met. Always be ready to give advice, listen
        to your problems, and make you laugh. Though always willing to end a
        hand or an open ear Dean continued to fight a battle of his own.
      </p>
      <p>
        After such a devastating loss, I have organized this annual motorcycle
        ride to not only remember Dean but also to raise awareness of the
        importance of mental health and provide that care to those in our
        community who cannot afford it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each ride is led by Dean's motorcycle, followed by tons of close friends
        and family. Tee shirts can be pre-ordered before the event and picked up
        daily. Raffle items are donated from dozens of local small businesses,
        restaurants, bars, etc. in order to raise funds that are donated to
        Place of Peace counseling in Wilmington, NC. This is a great way to give
        back to our community in more ways than one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to making this event bigger and better every year. We
        have been able to provide mental health care to multiple people in our
        community over the last few years and would not be able to do so without
        Place of Peace Counseling as well as all of our other local sponsors.
        Thank you for your support, and we hope to see you at the next event!
