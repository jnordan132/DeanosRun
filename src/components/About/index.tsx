        <b>
          On March 28, 2021, I lost my big brother, Dean, who was struggling
          severely with his mental health.
        </b>{" "}
        Dean was my best friend and the most genuine person I've ever met. He
        was always ready to offer great advice, listen to your problems, and
        make those around him laugh. While Dean was quick to lend a hand or an
        open ear, he was constantly fighting a battle of his own.
      </p>
      <p>
        After such a devastating loss,{" "}
        <b>
          I organized this annual motorcycle tribute ride to remember Dean,
          establish awareness around the importance of mental health, and raise
          funds to help provide care to those in our community who cannot afford
          such.
        </b>
      </p>

        <b>
          Deano's Run is a great way to help strengthen and support our
          community in more ways than one.
        </b>{" "}
        Each year, the ride is led with Dean's motorcycle, followed by tons of
        close friends, family, and supporters. A new t-shirt design is created
        for every event, t-shirts can be preordered before the event and picked
        up the day of. Raffle items are donated from local small businesses,
        restaurants, bars, etc., to assist in raising monetary donations for
        Place of Peace Counseling in Wilmington, NC.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          Through Deano's Run, we have been able to provide mental health care
          to several community members and hope to continue doing so.
        </b>{" "}
        We would not be able to do this without Place Of Peace Counseling and
        our other local sponsors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I look forward to making this event bigger and better every year.</b>{" "}
        Thank you for your support - we hope to see you at the next Deano's Run!
